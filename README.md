A text editor written with Blazor.

It edits the text synchronously with the UI SynchronizationContext in order to ensure the simplest implementation details.

Minimal during app customization is available to ensure an extremely light weight library.
One should use a CSS file prior to running the app to target the various UI and change them if so desired.

Only a Visual Studio light and dark theme clone are available.
The default can be chosen.

Beyond that, any logic to change mid app must be written by the user themselves
to again, keep things as light as possible.
